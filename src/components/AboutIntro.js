          Coleman Traders (Pty) Ltd was registered in 2016, focusing on selling
          containers and plant hire/sales. Since the economy took itâ€™s toll in
          2020, the director started focusing on small volume diesel deliveries
          which posed low risk. As he evolved in the industry, he identified a
          demand in the market for honest and reliable wholesale services.
          Thanks to dedicated staff led by Johnny, the company has been able to
          grow in both size and reputation.
